# **Hacker Rank 30 Day Challenge**
---
### Language: Python3
##### *(Unless otherwise noted in the code)*

- 2 entries for each day.
  -  Solution file = DayX_name_of_problem.py
      - Should Include Challenge Title.
      - My Solution.
  - Problem file = DayX_name_of_problem_problem.pdf
      - Downloaded PDF from hackerRank.
 
- *Will try to include notes about the solution or other ways to solve.*
---
#### Day 0:
- Solution on first try.
- Looked up how to make it a one liner.
  - Achieved one liner by used sep=""
    - e.g. print('Hello, World.', input_string, sep='\n')
---
#### Day 1:
- Solution worked on first try.
  - I didn't understand what "declare" meant, so i missed that step.
- Looked up declare and fixed the code to hit all requested fields.
  - Declare means to add a static value to the variable
    - e.g. x = 0; or y = 'Hello World!'
---
#### Day 2:
- Solution worked after 2 tries.
  - I didn't account for the *'tip_percent'* and *'tax_percent'* being percentages and not per calculated decimals.
    - This was in the instructions and i missed it.
- To fix it, I had to add more arithmatic:
  - *'..._percent'* / 100
---
#### Day 3:
- Today took quite a few tries to get right.
  - Using N % 3 == 0 was not ouputting anything.
    - Fix: N % 2 == 1. This is just another way to check if the integer input is Odd.
- I began by using a *for* loop with a range of (1, N, N + 1).
  - This didn't work because we were only dealign with a single digit, not all number up to N.
  - This made N **and** N+1 show in the ouput, printing two outputs.
